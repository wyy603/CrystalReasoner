    This class represents the complete state of a molecular system being integrated
    in the NPT (constant particle number, pressure, temperature) ensemble using
    Nose-Hoover chain thermostats for both temperature and pressure control.

    The cell dynamics are parameterized using a logarithmic coordinate system where
    cell_position = (1/d)ln(V/V_0), with V being the current volume, V_0 the reference
    volume, and d the spatial dimension. This ensures volume positivity and simplifies
    the equations of motion.

        positions (torch.Tensor): Particle positions with shape [n_particles, n_dims]
        momenta (torch.Tensor): Particle momenta with shape [n_particles, n_dims]
        forces (torch.Tensor): Forces on particles with shape [n_particles, n_dims]

            [n_systems, n_dimensions, n_dimensions]. Used to measure relative volume
            changes.

            Represents (1/d)ln(V/V_0) where V is current volume and V_0 is reference
            volume.
        cell_momentum (torch.Tensor): Cell momentum (velocity) conjugate to cell_position
            with shape [n_systems]. Controls volume changes.
        cell_mass (torch.Tensor): Mass parameter for cell dynamics with shape [n_systems].
            Controls coupling between volume fluctuations and pressure.
        barostat (NoseHooverChain): Chain thermostat coupled to cell dynamics for
            pressure control
        thermostat (NoseHooverChain): Chain thermostat coupled to particle dynamics
            for temperature control
        barostat_fns (NoseHooverChainFns): Functions for barostat chain updates

        current_cell (torch.Tensor): Current simulation cell matrix derived from
            cell_position. Shape: [n_systems, n_dimensions, n_dimensions]

    Notes:
        - The cell parameterization ensures volume positivity

    This function initializes a state for NPT molecular dynamics with a

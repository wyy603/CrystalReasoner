    This function estimates the minimum atomic diameter by considering different atomic

    element-specific radii: metallic radius for metals, and atomic/ionic radius for
    non-metals.

    The diameter represents a reasonable estimate for the closest approach between atoms,
    which is useful for initializing atomic positions or setting cutoff distances in
    simulations.

    approach to systematically sample different regions of the structure.

    Args:
        fractional_positions: Atomic positions tensor of shape [n_atoms, 3],
            where each row contains the (x,y,z) coordinates of an atom.
        species: List of chemical element symbols corresponding to each atom position.
        d_frac: Grid spacing in fractional coordinates used to define subcell boundaries.
            Smaller values create more overlap between subcells. Defaults to 0.05.
        n_min: Minimum number of atoms required in a subcell for it to be considered
            valid. Defaults to 1.
        n_max: Maximum number of atoms allowed in a subcell. Larger subcells take longer
            to relax. Defaults to 48.
        restrict_to_compositions: Optional list of chemical formulas (e.g. ["AB", "AB2"])
            to restrict which subcell compositions are extracted. Defaults to None.
        max_coeff: Optional maximum stoichiometric coefficient. If provided, only formulas
            up to this coefficient are considered (e.g. max_coeff=2 allows AB2 but not
            AB3). Defaults to None.
        elements: List of elements to consider when generating stoichiometries. Required
            if max_coef is provided. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        list[tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]]: Each tuple contains:
            - indices: Tensor of atom indices included in the subcell
            - lower: Tensor of lower bounds for subcell in fractional coords [3]
            - upper: Tensor of upper bounds for subcell in fractional coords [3]

    Notes:
        - The function uses fractional coordinates internally for consistent slicing
        - Subcells can overlap, providing redundancy in the search
        - Composition restrictions help focus on chemically relevant structures
